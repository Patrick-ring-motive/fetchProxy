# fetchProxy

This is a simple nodejs proxy that actually works and does what I need without all the unneeded complexity from all of the guides that I have followed and tried to use so far. No need for http-proxy or http-middleware-proxy or any number of packages. Just use fetch. It was annoying to find out after trying so many packages based on guides from stackoverflow and cdn blogs that I asked myself what if I just used fetch, and you know what it works. Why are people not doing this?
