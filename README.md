# fetchProxy

This is a simple nodejs proxy that actually works and does what I need without all the unneeded complexity from all of the guides that I have followed and tried to use so far. No need for http-proxy or http-middleware-proxy or any number of packages. Just use fetch. Jesus Christ it was annoying to find out after trying so many packages based on guides from stackoverflow and cdn blogs that I asked myself what if I just used fetch, and you know what it fucking works. Why are people not doing this?
